# Value investing


## Lesson 1 –  Introduction

Value investing is not value trading. In value trading, the item you are holding does not grow in value while being held. 


Asset – An asset is something that is going to continue to put more money in your pocket every month, while you own it. E.g. apartment complex, patent, etc.

Liability – Something which takes money out of pocket, i.e. it loses its value over time. E.g. car, laptop, etc.

## Lesson 2 – Value a small business

Total Revenue = Customers  Business

Cost of total Revenue = Business  Expenses

Income before taxes = Total Revenue – Cost of total Revenue

Net Income/Earnings = Income before taxes – taxes 

**Earnings are Net Income per share.**

The Net Income can go in two directions, to the owner or to the business. If it goes to the owner it will be dividend, if it goes to the business it will *hopefully* add equity to the business.


Big business structure
Board directors represent the shareholders.

Value a business – 

Q: What would you pay for a business which generates Net income of $20,000 per year.


| Amount       | Return         | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| 400,000       | 5%            | 
| 200,000	      | 10%           |  
| 100,000	      | 20%           |



The amount you chose to pay for the business determines the return (yield) you will be getting on the invested amount. If you pay higher, your yield would be lower. The thing to notice is in all situations the business is still the same, the amount you for it determines the your yield. 

**Warren Buffet likes to find companies which trade less than 15 times the earnings**

## Lesson 3 – Balance sheet and Margin of Safety

Three important financial documents that a business needs to have -

1.	Income statement – used to find company profit, has information about total revenue, total cost of revenue, income before taxes, taxes, net income / earnings
2.	Balance sheet – used to determine the margin of safety, gives information about Equity for a business or Book value for a share.
3.	Cash flow statement – 

Balance sheet – 
The balance sheet answers the question, “what would happen if the business is liquidated right now?”

Equity = Total Assets – Total Liabilities

When buying a business, the amount you are paying – the equity of the business = Risk of the investment. The closer the market price is to the equity, safer the investment. This is margin of safety. Margin of safety = Equity / Market value.

Side note about reinvesting the net incomes – 
If net income/earning is put back in the business instead of paying owners, it can be used to reduce liabilities and thereby increasing the equity of the business.

## Lesson 4 – Share

Shares outstanding – The number of pieces the business is broken into.

Whole Business 	 	Share 
Market price			Market price
Net income 			EPS (Earnings per share)
Equity 				Book value


Price to earnings ratio (P/E) = Market Price/ EPS

P/E ratio interpretation – 
For every (P/E) dollars I spend buying this stock, I should receive 1 dollar a year later. 

Book value = Total Equity/ Number of Shares

* The margin of safety is the difference between book value and the market price. *

## Lesson 5 – Warren Buffet stock basics

4 rules – 
1.	A stock must be stable and understandable.
2.	A stock must have long term prospects.
3.	A stock must be managed by vigilant leaders.
4.	A stock must be undervalued. 

A quick valuation tool – 

P/E ratio indicates return. Low P/E ratio means more returns.

Market price / Book value Interpretation - 
Every MP/ BV dollars paid for this company has 1 dollar of Book Value.

MP/ BV indicates risk. Low MP / BV means more safety.


Warren Buffet was looking for stocks with P/E less than 15 and MP/BV less than 1.5

P/E * MP/BV < 22.5


>“I buy on the assumption that they could close the market tomorrow and not reopen it for five years.” – Warren Buffet 

## Lesson 6 – Bond 

Bond important terminology – 

Par value – 

Coupon Rate – Interest paid on par value

Interests are paid twice a year.

You get the par value back after the bond matures.
