# Value investing


## Lesson 1 –  Introduction

Value investing is not value trading. In value trading, the item you are holding does not grow in value while being held. 


Asset – An asset is something that is going to continue to put more money in your pocket every month, while you own it. E.g. apartment complex, patent, etc.

Liability – Something which takes money out of pocket, i.e. it loses its value over time. E.g. car, laptop, etc.

## Lesson 2 – Value a small business

Total Revenue = Customers  Business

Cost of total Revenue = Business  Expenses

Income before taxes = Total Revenue – Cost of total Revenue

Net Income/Earnings = Income before taxes – taxes 

**Earnings are Net Income per share.**

The Net Income can go in two directions, to the owner or to the business. If it goes to the owner it will be dividend, if it goes to the business it will *hopefully* add equity to the business.


Big business structure
Board directors represent the shareholders.

Value a business – 

Q: What would you pay for a business which generates Net income of $20,000 per year.


| Amount       | Return         | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| 400,000       | 5%            | 
| 200,000	      | 10%           |  
| 100,000	      | 20%           |



The amount you chose to pay for the business determines the return (yield) you will be getting on the invested amount. If you pay higher, your yield would be lower. The thing to notice is in all situations the business is still the same, the amount you for it determines the your yield. 

**Warren Buffet likes to find companies which trade less than 15 times the earnings**

## Lesson 3 – Balance sheet and Margin of Safety

Three important financial documents that a business needs to have -

1.	Income statement – used to find company profit, has information about total revenue, total cost of revenue, income before taxes, taxes, net income / earnings
2.	Balance sheet – used to determine the margin of safety, gives information about Equity for a business or Book value for a share.
3.	Cash flow statement – 

Balance sheet – 
The balance sheet answers the question, “what would happen if the business is liquidated right now?”

Equity = Total Assets – Total Liabilities

When buying a business, the amount you are paying – the equity of the business = Risk of the investment. The closer the market price is to the equity, safer the investment. This is margin of safety. Margin of safety = Equity / Market value.

Side note about reinvesting the net incomes – 
If net income/earning is put back in the business instead of paying owners, it can be used to reduce liabilities and thereby increasing the equity of the business.

## Lesson 4 – Share

Shares outstanding – The number of pieces the business is broken into.

Whole Business 	 	Share 
Market price			Market price
Net income 			EPS (Earnings per share)
Equity 				Book value


Price to earnings ratio (P/E) = Market Price/ EPS

P/E ratio interpretation – 
For every (P/E) dollars I spend buying this stock, I should receive 1 dollar a year later. 

Book value = Total Equity/ Number of Shares

* The margin of safety is the difference between book value and the market price. *

## Lesson 5 – Warren Buffet stock basics

4 rules – 
1.	A stock must be stable and understandable.
2.	A stock must have long term prospects.
3.	A stock must be managed by vigilant leaders.
4.	A stock must be undervalued. 

A quick valuation tool – 

P/E ratio indicates return. Low P/E ratio means more returns.

Market price / Book value Interpretation - 
Every MP/ BV dollars paid for this company has 1 dollar of Book Value.

MP/ BV indicates risk. Low MP / BV means more safety.


Warren Buffet was looking for stocks with P/E less than 15 and MP/BV less than 1.5

P/E * MP/BV < 22.5


>“I buy on the assumption that they could close the market tomorrow and not reopen it for five years.” – Warren Buffet 

## Lesson 6 – Bond 

Bond is nothing but a loan.

Simple Example - 
A corporation wants to build a new headquarters. It requires $500,000,000 to do so. The corporation goes to a Bank for the loan. After evaluating the financial health of the corporation, bank decides to give the corporation a loan. The bank creates 500,000 bonds worth $1000 for a term of 30 years with an interest rate of 5%. 

| Bond          |               | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Par Value     | $ 1000        | 
| Term	        | 30 Years      |  
| Coupon Rate   | 5%            |

Bank sells these bonds to investors for $1005. The $5 difference between the bond's par value and selling price is called Underwriter's fee and that's how the bank makes money. Investors get the Coupon Rate on the Par value of the bond per year. In this example, the investors would recieve $ 50 per year for 30 years. After 30 years the bond **matures** and the investor gets the Par Value of $1000 back. The coupon payments on Bonds are generally made twice a year.

Bonds are issues by corporations and goverments.

Federal Government bonds are zero risk bonds. (They can simply print more money to fulfill the bond obligations.)

Risks Associated with Bonds - 
1. Company or Government Failure
2. Changes in Interest Rates
3. Inflation

Order of Equity distribution in the case of Corporate Liquidations/Failure - 
1. Bond holders
2. Preferred Share holders
3. Common Share holders

Why investing in Bonds might be lucrative - 

|                                      |   2007        |   2009       | 
|:------------------------------------ |:-------------:|:------------:|
| 30 Year Federal Bond Coupon Rate     |  5%           |  2.83%       |
| Dow Jones Ind Average Return	       | 3.7%          |  6.7%        |

Let's say you bought a 30 year Federal Bond in 2007 for $1005. In two years the Coupon Rate on a 30 year Federal Bond fell to 2.83%, but the bond you are holding has a 5% Coupon Rate. The value for this bond is now $1418. If you choose to sell this bond, you would make 413 + 100 (Coupon payments for 2 years). That's $ 513 return on $1005 investment.

## Lesson 7 – Components of a Bond 

1.**Par Value/ Face Value** - Par value is the amount you receive when the bond matures.
2.**Coupon Rate** - A coupon rate is the yield paid by Bond. The coupon rate is simply just the annual coupon payments paid by the issuer relative to the bond's face or par value.

Example - 
If you buy a 30 year bond with Par Value $1000 and Coupon Rate of 5%. You would receive $50 (Coupon Payments) Annually for 30 years, and $1000 (Par Value) after 30 years. 

Market Value variation of Bonds - 
As the interest rate changes in the market, the market price of the bond also changes. If the interest rate increases, the price of the bond decreases, and vice-versa. The price of the bond also depends on the time until maturity of the bond. As time progresses, the bond's market value approaches it's Par Value.


Example - 
The following table explains the Price Variation of a **30 year bond with Par Value of $1000 and Coupon Rate of 5%***.
The column 1 shows the time progression, column 2 shows the Market Price of the bond in the case of higher market Interest Rate of 6%, column 3 shows the Market Price of the bond in the case of lower market Interest Rate of 4%.

|            |   Case 1 - IR = 6%   |   Case 2 - IR = 4%    | 
|:---------- |:-------------:|:------------:|
| 5 Years    |  871        |  1157       |
| 15 Years	 | 902|  1112      |
| 29 Years	 | 990        |  1010       |

## Lesson 8 - Bond Valuation and Yield to Maturity

**Simple Interest Valuation Methods -**

1. Coupon Yield = 1 years coupon payments / Par Value
2. Current Yield = 1 years coupon payments / Price

Current yield is applicable when you are buying a bond which has been in market for some time. If for a bond, market price == Par value, then Current Yield == Coupon Yield. Current value does not take in consideration the profit or loss that occurs when the bond matures, due the difference between Par Value and Market Price.

**Compound Interest Valuation Method -**
